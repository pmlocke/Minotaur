Writting by Patrick Locke

Minotaur is a quick program I wrote that simulates an individual wandering through a maze 
with or without knowledge of the exit's location. It will acknowledge dead ends and backtrack 
only as necessary, remembering where it has previously travelled.

It can be exercised though its unit tests.
